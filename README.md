# Development Note
There's a lot of construction work at the moment. 
Don't use this library yet! Unless you want to contribute, of course. 
In terms of design there is nothing definitive, 
at the moment I'm still working on an API and I'm still in the research phase. 
Feel free to ping me in the amethyst discord (Timon | Flying Dutchman#4256)

# Network Synchronisation
This library offers an abstraction for synchronizing entities across the network. 
It can be used for higher level ECS-libraries. Such as [legion-sync](https://github.com/entity-sync-rs/legion-sync)
or specs (low-prio).
